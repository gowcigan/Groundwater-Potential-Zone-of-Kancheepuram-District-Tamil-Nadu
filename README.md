## INTRODUCTION
Groundwater exists in three primary forms: as vast bodies in oceans, lakes; flowing bodies like rivers, springs; and subsurface water within pore spaces and rock cavities forming underground reservoirs. Aquifers' dimensions (thickness, length, breadth) dictate groundwater reservoirs. Hydrostatic head drives water movement, often laterally through percolation. The critical "water table" marks the upper surface of the saturated zone. Vital in dry regions, groundwater serves as a primary water source, crucial for economic and sanitary purposes worldwide. Meteoric, connate, and juvenile sources contribute to groundwater. Kancheepuram, an industrialized and agricultural hub, faces fluctuating groundwater levels, high in rainy seasons and low in summers, necessitating its conservation due to high demand.
## STUDY AREA
Kancheepuram district, a part of Tamil Nadu, was formed in 1997 from the older Chengalpattu district. It shares borders with Chengalpattu, Rani pet, Tiruvannamalai, and Tiruvallur districts. Spanning 4,43,210 hectares, the region experiences an average annual rainfall of 1200mm, primarily from the northeast and southwest monsoons. The Palar River, although dammed upstream, remains a significant river in the area, with few elevated hills and 25,586 hectares of forest cover comprising Clay Loam, Loam, and Sandy Loam soil types.
It lies  between 12° 14′ 00″ N to 13° 02′ 00″ N latitude, 79° 31′ 30″ E to 80° 15′ 30″ E longitude. 
## DATA COLLECTION
Data for the research region was gathered using USGS Earth Explorer’s latitude and longitude 
functions. Data from Landsat’s Type 8 and Type 9 Collection 2 Level 2 were gathered. The USGS can 
download DEM. To find the hydrological parameters, employ DEM. FAO soil map shape files in the 
ESRI shapefile standard may be used to gather soil map preparation. India Remote Sensing can gather 
Swat data. (Gupta.M and Srivastava.P.K, (2010). Data on rainfall was gathered by CRU and the 
Tamil Nadu Public Works Department. The cell size (XY) for this layer, which was judged to be a 
thematic layer, is 30.46741637, ( Haridas.V.R, Aravindhan.S and Girish.G, (1988), and the spatial 
reference is WGS_1984_UTM_Zone_44N.
## METHODS AND METHODOLOGY
NDVI stands for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
 NDVI = (NIR-RED)/(NIR+RED)
NDWI stands for Normalized Difference Water Index
 NDWI = (Green-NIR)/(Green+NIR)
BSI stands for Bare Soil Index
 BSI = (SWIF-RED)/(SWIR+RED)

Groundwater Potential is depending on the Land Use and Land Cover, Watershed, Line density, Soil, 
Slope, Rainfall data can be identified by the tool of Weighted Overlay’s in Spatial Analyst.
## RESULT AND DISCUSSION
The presence of groundwater under the surface of the earth may be determined by the thematic 
sections of satellite images. Groundwater is mostly dependent on geology and geomorphology and 
can permeate the ground through precipitation.
